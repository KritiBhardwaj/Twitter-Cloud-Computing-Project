that may be true, but I think there's enough callers who do pick those things up. And there's one caller we know and love who does know they've galloped - just doesn't tell us. The other thing is they can be distracted by giving COT, birthdays, get wells and death messages.

Of course it can be a coincidence. It was probably the best ball of Fleming’s career. And most Australians would have no idea of the birthdays of Ponting or Bradman or Gilchrist or Warne - let alone the birthday of a star from a different country.
Happiest of birthdays Christina!!! 🤗🤗🤗
Most likely. It’s probably the best ball of his career - not a surprise they’d have chosen it. And just like you don’t know the birthdays of, say, Andrew Johns and Gary Ablett, Aussies tend not to know SRT’s. Plus we also don’t know Johns’ or Ablett’s - b’days aren’t a big deal
Apparently my girlfriend takes dog birthdays to a new level. Happy birthday old girl.
Maybe it’s Indian Tendulkar is a national hero in India - sure. But in Australia he is ‘just’ a great cricketer. Plus, we tend not to celebrate the birthdays of our own stars all that much. Cricket Oz may’ve tweeted out Fleming’s birthday but the average person doesn’t care

And I bet you have a teacher u will always remember and adore. My mum was one for many kids and Im so fucking proud of her. Wish I was that good
Teachers basically raise your kids when you’re at work. They protect them, teach them to read, write, add, criticise, live, dance, play sport, about sex, about work, and they are criticised by everyone who hasn’t met a teacher. Ask your kids
The fact that you are saying “she was born with a condition” and making jokes about it is fucking disgusting because there are kids out there that actually were born with life threatening conditions. Let’s just hope your kids don’t grow up with some sort of condition.

Ouch, yes, I can relate. It is now a years since I broke up with my ex. She and I had been together for 6 years but we had to. We couldn't afford marriage at the time or control ourselves.

Rachel, take the marriage goal off the table and you'll start enjoying life? And not think you've failed when a guy you don't like doesn't like you?
Nope. A real marriage is between two partners, one of which supports the Adelaide Crows and the other who would take a bullet for the Sydney Swans. I feel sorry for our children.
Not to mention arranged marriage ( in this case Jewish)
Nine days is too far away. I want your marriage to happen now!

I was lucky enough to work with some incredible under 18’s during the marriage equality postal survey. Queer kids who were going to be directly impacted by the outcome, but deprived of the opportunity to vote. It’s galling.
Popularity does not equal quality, nor does it in any way represent the relative impact on society, otherwise you might find yourself conducting marriage services for the recently introduced couple type as per Marriage at First Sight.
Marriage made in heaven NOT.
If you follow my logic that a man and a woman (not immediately related to one another) should be able to marry it means that marriage would be illegal for everyone? Like to elain how that is in any sense logical?!

So your position is that people should be happy to marry who they wish - without exception, other than that they consent (although how you police that is a bit of a problem!). So you are now admitting that you are for incestous marriage - if two adults consent to it. Thanks

The wife's spoken word poverty. Beautiful.
A dear friend died this week from cancer aged 43. She gave life her all, was a warrior, beautiful mother&amp;wife, full of strength&amp;grace. Her wish for the rest of us left behind in a speech she gave a few weeks ago where she raised over $40,000 for cancer research, “Just be happy”.
It was 10 years before my wife knew were Warrnambool was ... I told her it was on the Murray.

5yo still coughing a lot after 10 days, wife took him to the doctor after school and they think it might be asthma. So we got oral steroids and an inhaler to try. We've been down this road once before, but with inhaler only, and I didn't think it was effective.

The biggest thing I struggle with is... do I want a partner? A relationship? Or companion. Society has told me I should get married because that’s what you should do. But I did that and it ended horribly. Is it so bad that I only want to spend time with someone on my terms?
Your man is gifted, and may you get married soon!!!
it’s the worsttttt. if I got married I legit would only have my sister and my best friend. nobody else plz.

I think the Duchess of Cornwall is not the Princess of Wales despite being married to the Prince of Wales. She probably could now Diana's stopped using it but I think Brenda says who can use what titles. Diana was Princess of Wales right up to her death, per Brenda's instruction.

I reckon they should get married - in real life! They’re both single, still great friends, both good-looking, their kids are grown up - why not? They’re perfect together!!

Spending the day playing , I’ve got two adult sons with my married couple. I wanted them to have a girl (finally). I manipulated it so she would have a girl and then she pops out twins!! TWINS GOD DAMN IT. Ruined everything
I was 36 when I got married, my wife was 32 at the time, it was the first marriage for each of us. Never "too old"!
Yes mate, 2007 was a bastard yr for us, lost both Dad and Mum within 6 months of each other! Like Bookends, married 1942,dad back from mideast, 3 day honeymoon, then off to New Guinea,to fight Japanese hordes. Anzac Day tomorrow, i shall attend service, wear his Medals,with Pride

Most of the time I find it hard to believe that I ended up married, as I am hopeless with meeting people and dating and relationships in general. Nick has a big heart to deal with all of my nonsense! He's 6.5 years older than me - his maturity helped when I had none, lol.

I'd as sure as hell want my wife and family with me. What's the point of being married if you are going to spend almost half of every year apart. It's just a sham marriage and of course couples will drift apart.
The Rock has a new beautiful baby daughter and people are seriously commenting that he has no morals or respect because he isn't married to the mother (Lauren Hashian). What year is it?! I can't believe having children out of wedlock is still something people care about.
but we are in LOVE and getting MARRIED
A married gay, Jewish man using words, not violence criticising a toxic, intolerant, medieval religious ideology is not bigotry either by your definition. Nor is he a “Nazi”. Maybe you should learn the fucking difference, along with the bed wetting mob chanting Nazi.
Opp she married.
Last night I dreamt I was married to . It was great, we were really happy.

He got married, supposedly. And supposedly not to a white guy. So not sure why he would be going out to a bar with that guy he's with. Unless that was all an alt-right made up lie too, to try to compensate for his support of white supremacists.

So I shouldn't recognise you as married unless you can show me biological proof? Maybe I don't believe in your qualifications or job title because the saliva test is inconclusive. I guess you're okay with some things... obviously just not with staying out of peoples lives.

We sound similar! I’m pretty much English, Scottish and Irish with one Portuguese sailor thrown in for fun. He was from the Azores (Portuguese colony) and married a daughter of a convict out here. The French goes back via London and (I think) Les Huguenots.
Good point! If he hadn't been given a peerage upon marriage, though, my understanding is he'd still be Prince William of Wales. Married men can still have their father's territorial designation. Women, however, automatically lose it upon marriage.
