that may be true, but I think there's enough callers who do pick those things up. And there's one caller we know and love who does know they've galloped - just doesn't tell us. The other thing is they can be distracted by giving COT, birthdays, get wells and death messages.

they won’t, and that’s ok. it will probably come up often over the next few months as you have events etc.. Don’t be afraid to plan reflection into them, and prepare yourself for it too. A place was sat at our family dinner table at birthdays etc for nearly 2 years. ️

Of course it can be a coincidence. It was probably the best ball of Fleming’s career. And most Australians would have no idea of the birthdays of Ponting or Bradman or Gilchrist or Warne - let alone the birthday of a star from a different country.

Most likely. It’s probably the best ball of his career - not a surprise they’d have chosen it. And just like you don’t know the birthdays of, say, Andrew Johns and Gary Ablett, Aussies tend not to know SRT’s. Plus we also don’t know Johns’ or Ablett’s - b’days aren’t a big deal

Maybe it’s Indian Tendulkar is a national hero in India - sure. But in Australia he is ‘just’ a great cricketer. Plus, we tend not to celebrate the birthdays of our own stars all that much. Cricket Oz may’ve tweeted out Fleming’s birthday but the average person doesn’t care

It’s an approach that’s having some success but individual providers have different models of care so we don’t know which work best. Needs research on this so there’s treatment fidelity. Also need to know whether kids are staying in school.

Popularity does not equal quality, nor does it in any way represent the relative impact on society, otherwise you might find yourself conducting marriage services for the recently introduced couple type as per Marriage at First Sight.

So your position is that people should be happy to marry who they wish - without exception, other than that they consent (although how you police that is a bit of a problem!). So you are now admitting that you are for incestous marriage - if two adults consent to it. Thanks

5yo still coughing a lot after 10 days, wife took him to the doctor after school and they think it might be asthma. So we got oral steroids and an inhaler to try. We've been down this road once before, but with inhaler only, and I didn't think it was effective.

I'd as sure as hell want my wife and family with me. What's the point of being married if you are going to spend almost half of every year apart. It's just a sham marriage and of course couples will drift apart.

Oh, right. When I was 13, I was mugged by a couple of lads quite a bit older than me. They said to me, "what you got for me bruv?" "£1.30..." I replied. So they told me to give them a pound. They stole my friend's phone though, unluckily for him. What's your point?

Impressive True. But a couple of minor corrections- 1. Most Sikhs have a middle name of ”Singh”, but choose to use it as their surname. Rajput’s have surname of “Singh” &amp; I am a Rajput. 2. Whilst I am not rich, I have no complaints. But certainly NOT as rich as you True 🤑

I'd as sure as hell want my wife and family with me. What's the point of being married if you are going to spend almost half of every year apart. It's just a sham marriage and of course couples will drift apart.

Haha if I'm not in a rush I'll stand but most of the time I'll walk up. Does my head in how obvious it is where you're supposed to stand or walk and people still get it wrong. The worst ones who are couples who want to hold hands and block everyone. Soppy cunts.

Why sex-ed? This poster has nothing to do with sex any more than a "draw your family" task does. Sure lots of couples have sex. Some of that sex created the kids in the class. Acknowledging romantic relationships doesn't equate with talking about sex.

Definitely Brighton, Bath and Stonehenge. Stonehenge has a fantastic museum exhibition so it’s worth the visit. Shopping through the lanes and North Laine in Brighton is a must. And Bath is stunning. Volunteers do daily free walking tours from Bath Abbey which I highly recommend!

Not so bad here. Both of us work. BFS not only supportive but has done all shopping and cooking for a few years now. Irritating that this means I should consider myself “lucky” and not simply “equal”. Or that his proficiency has to be celebrated through the deprecation of mine.

Ho hum. So many tweets, but you don't address the issues raised in the article. Your bio says.. "do it to them before they do it to you"... A declaration that you are frightened and prepared to use violence. I don't see much point engaging further with you.

Yes! I loved watching BTN. We had to do “BTN Reports” on issues that we saw on the show and I really enjoyed researching and discovering more about the stories. That was my first understanding of what journalism was and I ended up with a journalism degree.

I doubt that. Some still think Jesus spoke against divorce, for eg. His point tho was that Pharisees were using divorce to put wives in impossible positions &amp; legitimise their bit on the side. He urged us to stop focussing so much on strict rules &amp; Act w/ humanity, grace &amp; love.

Walking 15 kms per day, meal prepping, cutting the grog out entirely except for weekends my dude. Aiming for around 1800-2000 calories per day. Wouldn't be enough if not for the walk so it'll still be an effort. The hardest part (for me) is trying to socialise without wine.

I'm no fan of Rachael, but I really feel for her right now. I'm likely never getting married and I'm an age where I think I can safely say I'm never having kids...and I didn't eect that to be the case. It hurts.

So I shouldn't recognise you as married unless you can show me biological proof? Maybe I don't believe in your qualifications or job title because the saliva test is inconclusive. I guess you're okay with some things... obviously just not with staying out of peoples lives.

Good point! If he hadn't been given a peerage upon marriage, though, my understanding is he'd still be Prince William of Wales. Married men can still have their father's territorial designation. Women, however, automatically lose it upon marriage.

Good news! Technically, she will be a princess! She just won't be *titled* as a princess. Same with Kate. Fun fact: "Princess Diana" was never actually her title. Her formal title while married was HRH The Princess of Wales, and then Diana, Princess of Wales after the divorce.

I’m going to suggest that she’s no longer married BECAUSE of what she knows about men. If my marriage ever fails I’m pretty sure I’ll stay single for the remainder of my years too.
