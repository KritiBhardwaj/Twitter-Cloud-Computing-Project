@CRSaltmarsh @sherlockmichael @zzzpppo43286 Awan was wife and sister of Cain, and Azura, her sister was the wife of first Abel and after Cain killed him, his brother Seth. So both married their sisters. Just another day in biblical life.

@ColetteNicole @Nicole_Cliffe She never was "Princess Diana." The public called her that, but they were wrong. Her formal title while married was HRH The Princess of Wales, and then Diana, Princess of Wales after the divorce.

@ppyajunebug @Nicole_Cliffe Good news! Technically, she will be a princess! She just won't be *titled* as a princess. Same with Kate.
Fun fact: "Princess Diana" was never actually her title. Her formal title while married was HRH The Princess of Wales, and then Diana, Princess of Wales after the divorce.
