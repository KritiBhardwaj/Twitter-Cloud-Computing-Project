Melbourne have two home matches this season both expected to draw more than 70K. This is the first of them. The second? Yes, you guessed it - likely to be their Queen's Birthday clash against Collingwood. #AFLDeesTigers

@apexguy01 that may be true, but I think there's enough callers who do pick those things up. And there's one caller we know and love who does know they've galloped - just doesn't tell us. 

The other thing is they can be distracted by giving COT, birthdays, get wells and death messages.

@fashai @iShhhshank Of course it can be a coincidence. It was probably the best ball of Fleming’s career. And most Australians would have no idea of the birthdays of Ponting or Bradman or Gilchrist or Warne - let alone the birthday of a star from a different country.
@RunChristinaRun Happiest of birthdays Christina!!! 🎉🤗🤗🤗🎉
@Superr_Dada @iShhhshank Most likely. It’s probably the best ball of his career - not a surprise they’d have chosen it. 

And just like you don’t know the birthdays of, say, Andrew Johns and Gary Ablett, Aussies tend not to know SRT’s. Plus we also don’t know Johns’ or Ablett’s - b’days aren’t a big deal
Apparently my girlfriend takes dog birthdays to a new level. Happy birthday old girl. https://t.co/Eirn3I2ezT
@Superr_Dada @iShhhshank Maybe it’s Indian:)

Tendulkar is a national hero in India - sure. But in Australia he is ‘just’ a great cricketer.

Plus, we tend not to celebrate the birthdays of our own stars all that much. Cricket Oz may’ve tweeted out Fleming’s birthday but the average person doesn’t care
Thanks everyone for your sweet messages and texts for my birthday - or "Me-Day" as it's affectionately known in my household. Special mention to my lovely bf for a full day of treats and surprises and food and drinks...and a trampoline party. MORE BIRTHDAYS, PLEASE.

HAPPIEST OF HAPPY BIRTHDAYS TO ONE OF THE GREATEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD @mikaelakateoh 

😍😍😍 I LOVE YOU!!! https://t.co/HsbgRFqKnV
@drmathenge We all still have birthdays - always.
Bloody hell there are too many birthdays today and tomorrow
Wishing my bestie @tine_tiny the happiest of birthdays! We have travelled the world together, lived together, raised little girls and a puppy together! Its weird not being with you to celebrate but we will no doubt... https://t.co/md4OLbWEvo
Pizza and cake at 4pm as celebrations for birthdays and anniversaries ... this means of course - no dinner, no snacks, feet up, wine in hand
Note: if you answered mostly A’s then you are an arsehole. You’re “that guy”. Nobody likes you. This is why you don’t get invited to dinner parties and nobody calls you on your birthdays.

Happiest of birthdays to the cutest gal in Cali, @CaliRodi 💖✨ hope you’re having the most sparkly day and eat lots of #CAKE 🎂 love you so much! 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖 (kinda wish we had a pic together so I could post it) instead have this GIF https://t.co/8V7S7HcuQr
I'm under the assumption the people responsible for the security of rogue satellites over the U.S. are also responsible for ones that in the past have been used sensibly for coming of age birthdays etc and in that sense I applaud Mr Trumps decision to sack the person directly

@JonahMarais how many birthdays do you have in one year??
I remember I wanted a pet and my mum said “we can’t get one cause we have to celebrates it’s birthday and we don’t have money for always buying it cake and toys” but now I realise birthdays are a social construct, and that I’m the real boo boo the fool

Hey @facebook, how do I get no birthdays in my news feed? I'm tired of clicking hide and show fewer birthdays every time.  I don't just want fewer, I want none.  No birthdays.  At all.  Ever.  Is there a toggle setting or something?

When i was in year 8, i was being harrassed constantly one day. Kids were throwing scissors, pencils and whatever at me and saying some homophobic things. Then one of them, a girl, comes to me and starts yelling at me. I pushed her away from me.
@deemadigan Why not just make it up to however many kids is in the same immediate family? Parents with more than 1 or 2 need to catch a break sometimes.
100 Years ago tonight, the #ANZACs charged in Villers-Bretonneux freeing the town, opening the road to freedom to Amiens.

@Ithika Man we saw 2 weddings today. Must have been a day for them I guess?
Didn't realise how much I'm into weddings until today. Sure, the process of it all is a bit naff but seeing people genuinely in love is like nothing else.
@georgiaborr @SpeetySomething This was the story of my life, thank god for hot single bridesmaids at weddings
Available for weddings, Funerals &amp; Acquittals
Today, Saturday the 14th of April, is a perfect reason why, with outside weddings, there MUST be a known back up plan for your special day. Intense rain or heat is a major game player. Even more so if it’s a beach wedding.
Yuck yuck.

@clacksee @godzillachild @CattleCastle @rmholdsworth I'm awful too! While our wedding wasn't quite as awesome as yours, I did have non-white wedding dress, a pantomime horse, croquet and trivia - so I think all the worst people have offbeat weddings!

5yo still coughing a lot after 10 days, wife took him to the doctor after school and they think it might be asthma. So we got oral steroids and an inhaler to try. We've been down this road once before, but with inhaler only, and I didn't think it was effective.

@_IndianPsycho Also you think in work life people don’t enjoy parties 😁 head to crown,Ice Bar,Brown Alley Glamorama or platform24 on weekends pls you will find all of Uni stdnts or those who finished recently n  started working life.
To put that into perspective - Ch. 155 was published in Oct 2000. It's been so bizarre reading through close to two decades of a single story in the space of six months.  Helps when you have a bunch of free time on weekends and can't sleep some nights.

@pastasauca The biggest thing I struggle with is... do I want a partner? A relationship? Or companion. 

Society has told me I should get married because that’s what you should do. But I did that and it ended horribly. 

Is it so bad that I only want to spend time with someone on my terms?
@Bluebrooch_ Your man is gifted😂, and may you get married soon!!!💃🏻🕺🏻
@tj_ebooks it’s the worsttttt. if I got married I legit would only have my sister and my best friend. nobody else plz.

@SuperCroup @abcnews I think the Duchess of Cornwall is not the Princess of Wales despite being married to the Prince of Wales. She probably could now Diana's stopped using it but I think Brenda says who can use what titles. Diana was Princess of Wales right up to her death, per Brenda's instruction.

@abcnews @Barnaby_Joyce @PatsKarvelas I'd as sure as hell want my wife and family with me. What's the point of being married if you are going to spend almost half of every year apart. It's just a sham marriage and of course couples will drift apart.
The Rock has a new beautiful baby daughter and people are seriously commenting that he has no morals or respect because he isn't married to the mother (Lauren Hashian).
