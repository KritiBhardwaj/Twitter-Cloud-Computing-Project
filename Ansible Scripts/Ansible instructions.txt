1) To install Ansible (locally) run the following commands:

sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ansible

2) Go into the "hosts" file in etc/ansible/hosts and add target hosts.
You can specify the range, give group label or even manage inventory dynamically 
through OpenStack (*to be implemented*):

[harvesters]
127.0.0.1

3) Run this command to check your connection:

ansible --private-key=/.ssh/sergeykey.pem -i ./hosts harvesters -m ping -u ubuntu -b

Here, we first specify the location of the private key, then the location of the
hosts file, then issue the "ping" command, then specify the username to be used in
the SSH connection and finally request to be sudo user using -b

4) Run this command to launch the master playbook:

ansible-playbook -i ./hosts ./twitharvester.yaml --private-key=/.ssh/se
rgeykey.pem -u ubuntu
